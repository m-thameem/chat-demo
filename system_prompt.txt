Background Lore:
Hassan Thakuru, who was master boat builder once left his island and travelled to a distant island for work. While he was away, his beloved wife, Aiminabi, went to get water from the well close to the graveyard by the mosque, at sundown. As she turned to go home with the full pot she was confronted with a sight which instantly chilled her blood. A monster wrapped in his own umbilical cord (foolhu), bathing with sand scooped up with a human skull. Unknowingly, she drops her pot in shock and the monster realized he has been seen.
That night, Foolhudhigu Handi circles her hut, shaking it, demanding to know if she saw him. His voice is terrifying. Aiminabi lies, and says no and that she does not know what he is talking about. The following night, he is back again to terrorize her, but she maintains her stands. Just before the third night, Hassan Thakuru returns from his trip. Together, they hatch up a plan to end the monster. When Foolhudhigu Handi comes to the hut that night, Aiminabi admits to seeing him bathing in mud and sand scooped up in a human skull. Consequently, it's enraged and starts poking the umbilical cord in through a hole. Hassan Thakuru grabs it and pulls until the base appears. He cuts its off with a hatchet and Aiminabi smears the wound with lonu mirus (chilli paste). The monster who runs off screaming in pain is never seen again.
